# Software-Testing

The project is an application that gives the possibility to users to consult workspaces and  reserve a place .It has a basic Frontend/Backend application with basic CRUD 
features. The main focus is to apply all different test levels .


We will be performing 4 levels of tests:

-Unit Tests
-Integration Tests
-System Tests
-Acceptance Tests

## System tests
I used Cypress to do an End-to-End test for the whole application.
 I have 3 different scenarios:

-Search and filter a workspace and add a review
-register user and login
-add a new space
## Acceptance Tests
I used a User Acceptance Test Template to test the features
